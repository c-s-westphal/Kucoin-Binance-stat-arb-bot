# Kucoin-Binance-stat-arb-bot
After looking at price discrepancies across the kucoin and binance exchanges I thought I saw an opportunity for a stat-arb bot acting upon TRX/BTC and IOST/BTC pairs. 
Unfortunately oppurtunities turned out to be slightly too far and few between when trading  live. If this bot were to be profitable, or if you were to find a cross 
exchange oppurtunity that were profitable I would reccomend re-writing this bot as a crontab file.
